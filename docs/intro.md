A Snakemake storage plugin for reading and writing files on Microsoft Sharepoint sites. 
For now only tested with Sharepoint 2016 on premise, so if any issues arise with your 
SharePoint site, please file an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Hugovdberg/snakemake-storage-plugin-sharepoint).
